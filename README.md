I am a quantitative analyst working on a trading desk at an energy and commodities firm in London, United Kingdom.
My background is in physics and, after pursuing an undergraduate degree at Imperial College London and a masters at Durham University, I undertook a PhD in mathematics at the University of Sheffield. 
My research concerned quantum field theory in curved spacetimes with a particular interest in black holes, and my thesis was entitled "Aspects of quantum charged scalar field theory in curved spacetime: Black hole superradiance and Hadamard renormalisation".
Subsequently, I continued my academic career as a Research Associate at the University of Sheffield.
Now, having learnt a lot of financial mathematics, programming and machine learning, I'm working as a quant in the financial services industry.
